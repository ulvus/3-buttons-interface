Cognitive #
Cognitive impairment is a broad category, encompassing topics such as ADHD, dyslexia, and autism, just to name a few. The accommodations for these users are quite diverse, but generally speaking, users may seek to minimize distractions, flashing, heavy animations, and anything which shifts the user's context around the page in an unexpected way. Users may also use custom colors and styles to improve readability or prevent headaches.

When I shall install and use web gui, companion, desktop or cli of ipfs, Im missing and will suggest a test of user behavior on ipfs.io and a updated user interface for use of ipfs. Docs and dev portal, could also need some changes, still it all rely of the good, and ground breaking work from protocol lab, core developer and contributor.

Product idea
Make better ux ui and other changes, so windows users, mostly people with special need, like autisme / adhd(i live with it),easily can onboard and use ipfs. Other users, contributer, and hackers will benefit from it to.
