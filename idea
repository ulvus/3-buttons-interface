When I shall install and use web gui, companion, desktop or cli of ipfs, Im missing and will suggest a test of user behavior on ipfs.io and a updated user interface for use of ipfs. Docs and dev portal, could also need some changes, still it all rely of the good, and ground breaking work from protocol lab, core developer and contributor.

Product idea
Make better ux ui and other changes, so windows users, mostly people with special need, like autisme / adhd(i live with it),easily can onboard and use ipfs. Other users, contributer, and hackers will benefit from it to.
